# Crop-Research-Project
Blockchain and Data Analytics-based Crop Recommendation System for Precision Farming in IoT Environment

About the Project

Problem:
Farmers often select crops based on intuition rather than scientific soil data, leading to poor yield, nutrient imbalance, and higher risks of crop failure.

This system addresses soil degradation and inefficient crop selection by farmers through an IoT-based recommendation algorithm that analyzes soil nutrients (N, P, K, pH) in real-time. The solution combines blockchain technology for secure data transmission with machine learning models to recommend optimal crop combinations and mixed-cropping strategies. The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy among tested algorithms for predicting crop compatibility.

Technologies Used:

Machine Learning: Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Gradient Boosting

Blockchain: Smart contracts for secure IoT data transmission

IoT Sensors: NPK sensors, pH sensors, humidity sensors

Data Processing: MQTT protocol, Min-Max normalization

Dashboard: Real-time monitoring interface

Results
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy for mixed-cropping compatibility prediction. The system successfully demonstrates real-time soil nutrient analysis with blockchain-secured data transmission, providing farmers with crop recommendations based on 4-parameter soil matching.
